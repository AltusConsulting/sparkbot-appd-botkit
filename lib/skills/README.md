# Placeholder for your bot's skills

Add scripts to enrich your bot skills.

_Note that the skills are imported in alphabetical order of their file name. As such, the fallback skill is prefixed with a 'Z-' to ensure it is loaded last, ie, if no pattern match, the fallback skill will apply to any message sent to the bot_


This directory and subdirectories are automatically imported by the Cisco Spark starter kit.

_Note that you can place common code in the 'utils' directory, as it is not loaded automatically by design._
